# 🌍 Project Documentation: International Student Population Analysis  

---

## 📌 Project Overview and Purpose  
This document provides the technical and analytical documentation for the **International Student Population Trend and Composition Analysis** dashboard, covering the academic years **2014/2015 through 2022/2023**.  

Developed entirely in **Power BI**, this project's primary objective was to move beyond simple reporting and transform raw enrollment data into a strategic, decision-making tool.  

The dashboard offers:  
- Critical visibility into demographic trends  
- Sustained growth trajectories  
- Performance of key international source markets  

These insights inform strategic planning for resource allocation and recruitment.

## 🗂️ Data Architecture, Modeling, and Preparation  

### 1️⃣ Data Source and Tooling  
- Core data originates from a single enrollment table, designated as **'Public Colleges'** in the Power BI Data Model.  
- All complex calculations and time-intelligence analyses are driven by **DAX** (Data Analysis Expressions) measures.  

### 2️⃣ Robust ETL and Data Cleaning (Power Query)  
Key steps executed in **Power Query**:  
- **Junk Removal**: Removed all blank rows and columns to streamline dataset and prevent errors.  
- **Dimensional Consolidation**: Eliminated redundant/irrelevant columns, following **star schema** best practices.  
- **Value Correction**: Standardized categorical fields (e.g., nationality names, gender labels).  

### 3️⃣ Calculated Columns for Time Intelligence  
Created a numerical calculated column `StartYear` for YoY analysis:  

```DAX
StartYear = VALUE( LEFT ( 'Public Colleges'[Year], 4 ) )
```

Purpose: Extracts the numerical starting year from the academic year string (e.g., extracts 2022 from "2022/2023")

## 📈 Enrollment Growth Trend:

The annual student count has increased steadily, rising from 21K in 2014/2015 to 38K in 2022/2023. This trajectory validates internationalization strategies.

YoY Change Measure precisely quantifies this growth:

```DAX
YoY Change = 
VAR CurrentYear = MAX('Public Colleges'[StartYear])
VAR CurrentTotal =
    CALCULATE(
        SUM('Public Colleges'[Number of Students]),
        'Public Colleges'[StartYear] = CurrentYear
    )
VAR PrevTotal =
    CALCULATE(
        SUM('Public Colleges'[Number of Students]),
        'Public Colleges'[StartYear] = CurrentYear - 1
    )
RETURN
    CurrentTotal - PrevTotal
```

### Detailed Visual Construction and DAX Implementation

1. Top-Tier KPI Cards
The four main KPI cards were built on robust DAX measures to ensure reliable, context-aware aggregation:

Total Students (Cumulative):

```DAX
Total Students = SUM('Public Colleges'[Number of Students])
```

## Students in Latest Year:
Dynamically calculates enrollment for the most recent academic year available in the data

```DAX
Latest Year Students = 
VAR MaxYear = MAX('Public Colleges'[Year])
RETURN
    CALCULATE(
        SUM('Public Colleges'[Number of Students]),
        'Public Colleges'[Year] = MaxYear
    )
```

## Female Student Share:
Calculates the percentage of female students across the entire population base

```DAX
Female Student Share = 
VAR Total = SUM('Public Colleges'[Number of Students])
VAR Female = CALCULATE(
    SUM('Public Colleges'[Number of Students]),
    'Public Colleges'[Gender] = "Female"
)
RETURN
    DIVIDE(Female, Total, 0) * 100
```

## Dominant Nationality Group:
Identifies the single group with the highest total enrollment, crucial for marketing prioritization

```DAX
Dominant Nationality Group = 
VAR TopRow =
    TOPN(
        1,
        SUMMARIZE(
            'Public Colleges',
            'Public Colleges'[Nationality],
            "Total", SUM('Public Colleges'[Number of Students])
        ),
        [Total], DESC
    )
RETURN
CONCATENATEX(TopRow, 'Public Colleges'[Nationality], ", ")
```
